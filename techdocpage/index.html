            Minecraft. A game where you can basically make it what you want it
            to be. Is it adventure? Yes. Is it survival? Yes. Is it
            action.....yes! But we aren't here to actually talk about what
            <em>MINECRAFT</em> is, no. We are here to get into the
            <em>server</em> side of the game. On that note...
          </p>
          <h1>What is a Minecraft server?</h1>
          <p>
            A Minecraft server, at it's core, is the <strong>WORLD</strong> in
            which the player(s) interact. It's the blocks, the chunks, the
            spawns, the entities, heck, even the clouds. More specifically: A
            Minecraft server is a player-owned or business-owned multiplayer
            game server for the 2011 Mojang Studios video game Minecraft. In
            this context, the term "server" often colloquially refers to a
            network of connected servers, rather than a single machine. Players
            can start their own server either by setting one up on a computer
            using software provided by Mojang, or by using a hosting provider so
            they can have their server run on dedicated machines with guaranteed
            uptime. The largest server is widely accepted to be the minigame
            server Hypixel. Minecraft multiplayer servers are controlled by
            server operators, who have access to server commands such as setting
            the time of day, teleporting players and setting the world spawn.
            The server owner (or users that have access to the live server
            files) can also set up and install plugins to change the mechanics
            of the server, add commands among other features, and can also set
            up restrictions concerning which usernames or IP addresses are
            allowed or disallowed to enter the game server. Multiplayer servers
            have a wide range of activities, with some servers having unique
            premises, rules, and customs. Player versus player (PvP) combat can
            be enabled to allow fighting between players. Custom plugins and
            mods can be used in servers to allow actions that are not normally
            possible in the vanilla form of the game. There are also several
            modifications of the server software that can allow crossplay
            between the Java and Bedrock editions of the game.

          <p>A list of questions you should ask yourself</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Do you want to host it yourself?</li>
            <li>Should you host it yourself?</li>
            <li>Do you have the hardware to host a server?</li>
            <li>If you have the hardware, should you use it to host?</li>
            <li>
              Do you have knowledge of operating systems other than windows i.e.
              Linux?
            </li>
            <li>Do you know enough about the game to understand hosting it?</li>
          </ol>

            The good news about hosting a Minecraft server is that it's been out
            for <em>so long</em> that is will run on a toaster. The bad news is
            that it's <em>so old</em> that if you don't give it enough oomf,
            your toaster won't even be able to singe that Minecraft bread. You
            can easily host it on the very PC you are playing on, and it will
            probably be fine for you and one friend. Anything more than that
            though, and your computer will struggle to do the most basic tasks.
            So what to do?
          </p>
          <p>
            So, the good news. If you have a spare computer that is
            <em>somewhat</em> relevant in terms of specs, you are more than
            fine. I run mine on a 6th gen Intel, with 32GB of RAM and a 500GB
            NvME drive. Not old, but not new by any means whatsoever. You can
            even go super low spec, some people run their servers on Single
            Board PCs, such as a Raspberry Pi! I recommend at least a 4th Gen
            CPU (Intel or AMD, whatever your flavour), and as much RAM as you
            can find/buy. You will not regret jamming as much RAM as you can for
            the server. This becomes <em>very important</em> as you start to add
            players, mods, variables and untangibles.

            There are many different flavours of OS available, and I will link
            them all at the bottom of the page. You can use <code>Windows</code>, <code>Linux </code>, <code>Mac</code>,
            <code>Raspian</code>, and many other variables within that. That being said, the
            overall best choice is Linux. But that in and of itself opens up a
            myriad options, so I will keep it as simple as possible. It breaks
            down like this:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Linux-based OS (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora etc)</li>
            <li>
              OR! You can even use an OS built entirely for Minecraft Server
              Hosting
            </li>
            <li>Management Console (pufferpanel, Crafty, All the mods etc)</li>
            <li>Profit!</li>

          <p>
            have two options when it comes to versions of Minecraft to host.
            Minecraft <code>Java edition</code>, or <code>Bedrock edition</code>. I personally don't have
            experience hosting Bedrock, so I will stick with talking about Java.

            There are already nearly unlimited possibilities within the magical
            world of Minecraft, but you can make it even grander with mods. Mods
            are additions and expansions (usually built by third parties) that
            can do practically anything you can imagine, from completely
            altering a game's core mechanics to simple things like tweaking
            textures and models.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mods in Minecraft: Java Edition can massively expand the
            possibilities of play. You can even create your own mods for
            Minecraft: Java Edition if you're so inclined. Before you can begin
            installing and playing with mods, though, there are a few things for
            which you'll need to prepare.
