            Minecraft. A game where you can basically make it what you want it
            to be. Is it adventure? Yes. Is it survival? Yes. Is it
            action.....yes! But we aren't here to actually talk about what
            <em>MINECRAFT</em> is, no. We are here to get into the
            <em>server</em> side of the game. On that note...
          </p>
          <h1>What is a Minecraft server?</h1>
          <p>
            A Minecraft server, at it's core, is the <strong>WORLD</strong> in
            which the player(s) interact. It's the blocks, the chunks, the
            spawns, the entities, heck, even the clouds. More specifically: A
            Minecraft server is a player-owned or business-owned multiplayer
            game server for the 2011 Mojang Studios video game Minecraft. In
            this context, the term "server" often colloquially refers to a
            network of connected servers, rather than a single machine.
            Players can start their own server either by setting one up on a
            computer using software provided by Mojang, or by using a hosting
            provider so they can have their server run on dedicated machines
            with guaranteed uptime. The largest server is widely accepted to
            be the minigame server Hypixel. Minecraft multiplayer servers
            are controlled by server operators, who have access to server
            commands such as setting the time of day, teleporting players and
            setting the world spawn. The server owner (or users that have access
            to the live server files) can also set up and install plugins to
            change the mechanics of the server, add commands among other
            features, and can also set up restrictions concerning which
            usernames or IP addresses are allowed or disallowed to enter the
            game server. Multiplayer servers have a wide range of activities,
            with some servers having unique premises, rules, and customs. Player
            versus player (PvP) combat can be enabled to allow fighting between
            players. Custom plugins and mods can be used in servers to allow
            actions that are not normally possible in the vanilla form of the
            game. There are also several modifications of the
            server software that can allow crossplay between the Java and
            Bedrock editions of the game.
